> **Project**: BeamFinder
> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-10
> **Current Phase**: Phase 1 — Foundation (Not Started)

## Active Context

- Project initialized with SPEC, ROADMAP, and supporting docs
- No code written yet
- Next step: `/plan 1` to create Phase 1 execution plan

## Key Decisions

_None yet. See DECISIONS.md for ADR log._

## Blockers

_None._

## Notes

- Using YOLO26n (nano) pretrained on COCO for Phase 1
- COCO doesn't have a dedicated "drone" class — may need to assess detection quality and consider fine-tuning in future phases
- Dataset of drone images is already available with the user
