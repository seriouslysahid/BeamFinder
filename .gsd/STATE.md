> **Project**: BeamFinder
> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-10
> **Current Phase**: Phase 1 — Foundation (Planned)

## Active Context

- Phase 1 planned with 2 plans, 4 tasks total
- Plan 1.1: Project structure & dependencies (wave 1)
- Plan 1.2: Configuration module & README (wave 1)
- Next step: `/execute 1` to run all Phase 1 plans

## Key Decisions

_See DECISIONS.md for ADR log._

## Blockers

_None._

## Notes

- Using YOLO26n (nano) pretrained on COCO for Phase 1
- COCO doesn't have a dedicated "drone" class — may need to assess detection quality and consider fine-tuning in future phases
- Dataset of drone images is already available with the user
